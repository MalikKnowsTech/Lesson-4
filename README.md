# Lesson-4: List Types

In this lesson I learned:
dl - description list
dt - descritption term (thing we want to talk about)
dd - description details (where we talk about the dt)

ul - un-ordered lists
ol - ordered lists
li - lists

dt followed by dd creates an indentation
ul creates a bulleted list
ol creates a numerical list
